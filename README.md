# Three-Kingdoms
Tactical simulation grand strategy game based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Instead of keeping save data in a database, the game provides players with a variety of tools to manage their own save data, such as: COPY DATA, DOWNLOAD DATA, and IMPORT DATA. This approach gives players more control over their save data and allows them to easily transfer it between devices.
